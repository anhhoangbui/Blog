The The text is also not clear if it’s referring to the median age of the labour force or the median age of the population\r\nThe median lines should be removed. Some simple annotation would suffice to state the median age in 2009 and 2019\r\n3\r\nTitle does not represent the message the data visualization tries to convey\r\nRewrite the title to better describe the data visualization\r\n4\r\nThe line graph does not have a Y-axis\r\nAdd a Y-axis and clearly label the ticks with percentage\r\nAesthetic\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\nThe background color being grey serves no purpose and makes the 2 colors in the visualization less contrasting. These choice of colors would also be indistinguishable if the report is not color printed\r\nUse a white background with a colored border around the visualization if needed\r\n2\r\nTable headers are used as the x-axis of the table which makes the line graph on top looks out of place\r\nUse a separate chart instead\r\n3\r\n“70&Over” is too long for the table cell, making it look crammed\r\n“70+” would be more space efficient while still able to convey the meaning\r\nProposed Design\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow-to Guide\r\nButterfly Chart\r\nCopy the data into a new Excel worksheet as the original file has a lot of formatting.\r\nOpen Tableau and connect to the data in the new Excel worksheet.\r\nHold Ctrl and click on the columns 2009 and 2019.\r\nRight-click on one of the selected columns and select Pivot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRename the pivoted columns to Year and Labour Force and change the data type of column Year column to Date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGo to Sheet1 and rename the sheet to 2009.\r\nDrag-and-drop Year and Labour Force to the Columns card and Age to the Rows card.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRight-click on the Year pill to select Filter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUn-check 2019 from the list and select OK.\r\nRight-click on the Labour Force pill and select Quick Table Calculation > Percentage of Total.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHold Ctrl, drag-and-drop the Labour Force pill from the Columns card to Color in the Marks card.\r\nIn the Marks card, click on Label and select Show marks labels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRight-click on the X-axis and select Edit Axis:\r\nIn the Range section, select Fixed and set the start and end values to 0 and 0.175, respectively.\r\nIn the Scale section, select Reversed.\r\nSet the title of the axis to 2009.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRight-click on the Age (Years) pill and un-check Show Header.\r\nRight-click on the Year pill and un-check Show Header.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Toolbar, select Format > Lines:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Columns tab, set Grid Lines to None.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSwitch to the Format Borders tool, under the Sheet tab.\r\nSet Row Divider Pane to None and Column Divider Pane to None.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bar chart should looks as below\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuplicate the 2009 sheet and rename it 2019.\r\nRight-click on the Year pill and select Edit Filter then un-check 2009 and check 2019.\r\nRight-click on the X-axis and select Edit Axis:\r\nUn-check Reversed.\r\nRename the axis’ title to 2019.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate a new sheet and name it Year.\r\nFrom the Toolbar, select Analysis > Create Calculated Field:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nName the calculated field Placeholder for Age.\r\nEnter 0 as the formula.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDrag-and-drop the Placeholder for Age field to the Columns card.\r\nDrag-and-drop the Age (Years) field to the Rows card.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChange the Marks type to Text.\r\nDrag-and-drop the Age (Years) field to Text in the Marks card.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRight-click on both the X-axis and Y-axis and un-check Show Header to hide the axis.\r\nRemove the sheet title.\r\nFrom the Toolbar, select Format > Lines:\r\nOn the Sheet tab, set Axis Rulers to None.\r\nOn the Sheet tab, set Zero Lines to None.\r\nOn the Columns tab, set Grid Lines to None.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReduce the width of the “chart” as much as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate a new Dashboard.\r\nArrange the 3 previous created sheets in the Dashboard to achieve the Butterfly Chart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStacked Bar Chart\r\nCreate a new Sheet called Comparison.\r\nIn the Data pane, right-click on Age (Years) and select Create > Group:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSet the Field Name to Age Group.\r\nUse Shift to select and group all the age groups from 15 to 24 into a group named 15 - 24.\r\nGroup all the age groups from 25 to 54 into a group named 25 - 54.\r\nGroup all rest of the age groups into a group named 55 and over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDrag-and-drop Year into the Rows card and Labour Force into the Columns card.\r\nRight-click on the Labour Force pill and select Quick Table Calculation > Percentage of Total.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRight-click on the Labour Force pill and select Compute Using > Table (across).\r\nChange the Marks type to Bar.\r\nDrag-and-drop the Age Group group into Color in the Marks card.\r\nDrag-and-drop the Age Group group into Detail in the Marks card.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRight-click on the Age Group pill in the Marks card and select Sort.

    "contents": "\r\n1.0 Overview\r\nCorrelation coefficient is a popular statistic that use to measure the type and strength of the relationship between two variables. The values of a correlation coefficient ranges between -1.0 and 1.0. A correlation coefficient of 1 shows a perfect linear relationship between the two variables, while a -1.0 shows a perfect inverse relationship between the two variables. A correlation coeficient of 0.0 shows no linear relationship between the two variables.\r\nWhen multivariate data are used, the correlation coeficeints of the pair comparisons are displayed in a table form known as correlation matrix or scatterplot matrix.\r\nThere are three broad reasons for computing a correlation matrix.\r\nTo reveal the relationship between highdimensional variables pairwisely.\r\nTo input into other analyses. For example, people commonly use correlation matrixes as inputs for exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation models, and linear regression when excluding missing values pairwise.\r\nAs a diagnostic when checking other analyses. For example, with linear regression a high amount of correlations suggests that the linear regression’s estimates will be unreliable.\r\nWhen the data is large, both in terms of the number of observations and the number of variables, Corrgram tend to be used to visually explore and analyse the structure and the patterns of relations among variables. It is designed based on two main schemes:\r\nRendering the value of a correlation to depict its sign and magnitude, and\r\nReordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that “similar” variables are positioned adjacently, facilitating perception.\r\nIn this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to plot data visualisation for visualising correlation matrix with R. It consists of three main sections. First, you will learn how to create correlation matrix using pairs() of R Graphics. Next, you will learn how to plot corrgram using corrplot package of R Lastly, you will learn how to create an interactive correlation matrix using plotly R. .\r\n2.0 Installing and Launching R Packages\r\nBefore you get started, you are required:\r\nto start a new R project, and\r\nto create a new R Markdown document.\r\nNext, you will use the code chunk below to install and launch corrplot, ggpubr, plotly and tidyverse in RStudio.\r\n\r\n\r\npackages = c('ggpubr', 'tidyverse')\r\n\r\nfor(p in packages){library\r\n  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){\r\n    install.packages(p)\r\n  }\r\n  library(p, character.only = T)\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0 Importing and Preparing The Data Set\r\nIn this hands-on exercise, the Wine Quality Data Set of UCI Machine Learning Repository will be used. The data set consists of 13 variables and 6497 observations. For the purpose of this exercise, we have combined the red wine and white wine data into one data file. It is called wine_quality and is in csv file format.\r\n3.1 Importing Data\r\nFirst, let us import the data into R by using read_csv() of readr package.\r\n\r\n\r\nwine <- read_csv(\"data/wine_quality.csv\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice that beside quality and type, the rest of the variables are numerical and continuous data type.\r\n4.0 Univariate EDA with Histogram\r\nIn the figure below, multiple histograms are plottted to reveal the distribution of the selected variables in the wine quality data sets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe code chunks used to create the data visualisation consists of two main parts. First, we will create the individual histograms using the code chunk below.\r\n\r\n\r\nfa <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `fixed acidity`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nva <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `volatile acidity`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nca <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `citric acid`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nrs <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `residual sugar`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nch <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `chlorides`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nfSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `free sulfur dioxide`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\ntSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `total sulfur dioxide`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\ndensity <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= density)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\npH <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= pH)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nsulphates <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= sulphates)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nalcohol <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= alcohol)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, the ggarrange function of ggpur package is used to group these histograms together.\r\n\r\n\r\nggarrange(fa, va, ca, rs, ch, fSO2, tSO2, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, \r\n          ncol = 4, nrow = 3)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

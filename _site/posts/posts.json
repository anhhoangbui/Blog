For example, on first glance, it would seem like in 2020, there are more Explosions events compare to Battles but it is in fact the other way around\r\nSynchronized all the Y-axis to have the same scale, or better yet, combine all 6 line charts into a single chart\r\n2\r\nTitle of the chart on the right does not reflect the content of the chart, which is a count of events per event type\r\nRephrase the title of the line charts to provide better details\r\n3\r\n“Count of Sheet1” is meaningless in explaining the Y-axis and redundant\r\nRemove “Count of Sheet1” from the visualization\r\n\r\nAesthetic\r\n\r\n1\r\nThe dots in the map do not have any borders and are not transparent, which makes it difficult to discern events which are overlapped or near to each other\r\nAdd borders for each point and make them slightly transparent\r\n2\r\nThe line charts are not color coded and ordered in a different order compare to the provided legend, which can cause confusion\r\nColor code the lines such that they follow the color of the Event Types in the map\r\n\r\nInteractivity\r\n\r\n1\r\nThe visualization does not provided a filter for Event Date and Event Type\r\nAdd a filter for Event Date and Event Type\r\n2\r\nThere are no interactions between the map and the charts on the right\r\nAdd interactions such as selecting a point in the map will highlight the line chart pertaining to the event type of the selected point\r\nProposed Design\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause the locations in the dataset are not standardized, the events can only be grouped to the Country level, hence choropleth map is not suitable to represent the data. A better way to visualize the spatial data is by using both a heatmap, for overview of the location and density of the armed conflict events, and a point distribution map for more detailed view of individual events. Users will have the option to switch between the 2 types of map.\r\nInstead of having separate line charts similar to the original visualization, combining the line charts into a single chart will make it easier to do comparison across event types. The lines will be color coded in the same color as the map’s legend.\r\nPutting the legend at the top right corner of the map will allow the legends be referenced when using both the map and the line charts.\r\nThe dataset contains event dates to the date level, hence some insights maybe lost when the events are grouped by year. Having a Date Granularity parameter will give users the option to group or drilldown by events dates, potentially providing additional insights.\r\nThe maps and the line charts are highly correlated so a helpful interaction would be to highlight the same event type on both the map and the line chart when user clicks on either a certain events in the map or a line in the chart.\r\nHow-to Guide\r\nPoint Distribution Map\r\nOpen Tableau and add the data file as a data source\r\nGo to Sheet1 and rename the sheet to Point\r\nAdd Longitude (generated) into the Columns card.\r\nAdd Latitude (generated) into the Rows card two times and make them Dual Axis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the first Marks card, set the mark type to Map and drag-and-drop Country into Detail. Set Color to #b4b4b4 with 40% opacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the second Marks card, set the mark type to Circle and drag-and-drop:\r\nEvent Type to Color.\r\nLatitude to Detail and set Measure to Average.\r\nLongitude to Detail and set Measure to Average.\r\nEvent Id Cnty to Detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSet the colors for Event Type as follow, using the color picker tool provided by Tableau.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSet the border color for the Circle mark to #555555 and opacity to 60%.\r\nAdd Country, Event Type and Event Date (by Year) to the Filters card. Right-click on each one of them and select Apply to Worksheets > All Using This Data Source.\r\nOn the Toolbar, change the map background color by selecting Map > Background Maps > Dark. By now, the visualization should look like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate a Parameter named Map Selection with the following properties:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow the Map Selection parameter and set the value to Point Distribution.\r\nCreate a Calculated Attribute named Selected Map with the formula below:\r\n[Map Selection]\r\nAdd the Selected Map attribute into the Filters card and select the Point Distribution checkbox in the filter dialogue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHeatmap\r\nCreate a new sheet and name it Heatmap.\r\nAdd Longitude too the Columns card and Latitude to the Rows card. Right-click on each of the pills and select Dimension.\r\nSet the Marks type to Density.\r\nDrag-and-drop Country to Detail in the card.\r\nDrag-and-drop Event Type to Detail in the card.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSet the mark Color to Density Dark Red and Intensity to 90%.\r\nLower the Size of the marks to about 1/4 of the bar.\r\nOn the Toolbar, change the map background color by selecting Map > Background Maps > Dark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow the Map Selection parameter and set the value to Heatmap.\r\nAdd the Selected Map attribute into the Filters card and select the Heatmap checkbox in the filter dialogue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLine Chart\r\nCreate a new sheet called Line.\r\nCreate a new Parameter called Date Granularity with the following properties. Note: the values on the left column need to be in lower case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate a new Calculated Attribute called Date Truncated with the formula below:\r\nDATE(DATETRUNC([Date Granularity], [Event Date]))\r\nCreate a new Parameter called Charts By with the following properties:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate a new Calculated Attribute called Chart Count with the formula below:\r\nIF [Charts By] = 'Events' \r\nTHEN 1 \r\nELSE [Fatalities]\r\nEND\r\nAdd Date Truncated to the Columns card. Right-click on the pill and select Exact Date.\r\nAdd Chart Count to the Rows card.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSet the Marks type to Line.\r\nDrag-and-drop Event Type to Color in the Marks card.\r\nOn the Toolbar, select Format > Shading. 11 Set the Worksheet shading color to #333333.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same format pane, switch to the Lines tab and set the Sheet Grid Lines to dotted line with the color #f5f5f5.\r\nSet the titles of both axis to the color #f5f5f5.\r\nSet the title of the worksheet to:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate a Calculated Field named Date Display with the formular below:\r\nCASE [Date Granularity]\r\n    WHEN 'day' THEN STR([Date Truncated])\r\n    WHEN 'week' THEN 'Week ' + DATENAME([Date Granularity],[Event Date]) + ' of ' + DATENAME('year', [Event Date])\r\n    WHEN 'month' THEN DATENAME([Date Granularity],[Event Date]) + ' ' + DATENAME('year', [Event Date])\r\n    WHEN 'quarter' THEN 'Q' + DATENAME([Date Granularity],[Event Date]) + ' ' + DATENAME('year', [Event Date])\r\n    WHEN 'year' THEN DATENAME([Date Granularity],[Event Date])\r\nEND\r\nClick on Tooltip in the Marks card and set it as follow:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBar charts\r\nCreate a new sheet called Bar.\r\nCreate a new Calculated Attribute called Bar Size with the formula below. This formula is to calculate the width of a bar, with the 0.9 modifier used to create small gap between bars.\r\n0.9*DATEDIFF('day', [Date Truncated], DATEADD([Date Granularity], 1, [Date Truncated]))\r\nAdd Date Truncated to the Columns card. Right-click on the pill and select Exact Date.\r\nAdd Chart Count to the Rows card.\r\nSet the Marks type to Bar.\r\nDrag-and-drop Bar Size to Size in the Marks card and change its measure to Average.\r\nClick on Size in the Marks card and select Fixed. Set Alignment to Center.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChange the bar color to #f98b00.\r\nOn the Toolbar, select Format > Shading. 10 Set the Worksheet shading color to #333333.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSet the titles of both axis to the color #f5f5f5.\r\nSet the title of the worksheet to:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDashboard\r\nBefore we can start arranging the the dashboard, we need to create a couple more components.\r\nCreate a new Excel or csv file with the following data:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate a new sheet in Tableau called Map Selection.\r\nAdd the excel (or csv) file into the sheet as a new data source by selecting Data > New Data Source on the Toolbar.\r\nCreate a new Parameter called Map Selection with the following properties:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate a Calculated Attribute called Selected Map Color with the formula below:\r\nIF [Chart Value]=[Map Selection]\r\n    THEN 1\r\n    ELSE 0\r\nEND\r\nAdd Chart Title to the Rows card.\r\nAdd Selected Map Color to Color in the Marks card.\r\nAdd Chart Title to Text in the Marks card.\r\nAdd Chart Value to Detail in the Marks card.\r\nSet the sheet background color/shading to #333333 and remove all row and column lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate a new sheet called Tooltip.\r\nAdd Chart Count to the Columns card and Event Type to the Rows card.\r\nRight-click on Event Type and select Sort. Configure the sort as follow:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd Event Type to Color in the Marks card.\r\nGo back to the Bar worksheet.\r\nClick on Tooltip in the Marks card and set it as follow:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate a new Dashboard called Dashboard.\r\nSet the dashboard Size to 1600x950.\r\nSetup the initial layout for the dashboard as follow, using the Vertical object for the map, charts, and filter layout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSet the Map Selection parameter to Point Distribution and add the Point worksheet into the Map Vertical Layout layout and remove the title.\r\nSet the Map Selection parameter to Heatmap, which will make the Point sheet hidden on the dashboard, and add the Heatmap worksheet into the same Map Vertical Layout layout then remove the title.\r\nAdd the Line and Bar sheets into the Charts Vertical Layout layout, with the Line sheet on top.\r\nAdd all the filters into the Filters layout.\r\nRemove the Map Selection parameter from the dashboard since we’re going to use a dashboard action to trigger the parameter.\r\nAdd the dashboard title and the map title worksheets into their respective layout. The dashboard should look like this at this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd a new Vertical layout object into the Filter layout and add the Map Selection worksheet and the Event Type legend to it, with the Map Selection on top.\r\nMake the new Vertical layout a Floating layout and set the background shading to #333333 and border to #f5f5f5.\r\nMove the floating vertical layout to the top right of the map.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Toolbar, select Dashboard > **Action>>.\r\nAdd the following dashboard actions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinal Dashboard\r\nLink to Tableau Public\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternative view with different map type and date granularity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInsights\r\nMost of the armed conflicts in South East Asia are centralized in Myanmar and Philippines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a large spike of events and fatalities during Q3 2016, which is due to the violence against civilians events in Philippines\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom 2015 to 2020, the most common armed conflict events in Myanmar are of the “Battles” type, with a larger cluster on the Western coast of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn recent years, protests are the most common type of armed conflicts in SOuth East Asia, with a relatively even split across many countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Battles” and “Violence against civilians” type of events are the most deadly, contributing to most of fatalities during the period from 2015 to 2020.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Not only that, “Vac_1” is also meaningless to users since it is only a code to refer to the actual question\r\nThe survey question should be clearly displayed in the data visualization, not necessarily above the legend\r\n3\r\nA 100% stacked bar chart is not a suitable visualization for this data since it can be difficult to compare the bars between countries\r\nUse a divergent stacked bar chart\r\n4\r\nThe bar chart on the right is trying to show the percentage of the “Strongly Agree” response to the survey question, which contains uncertainties since a survey does not represent the whole population, hence the chart needs to also visualize the uncertainty\r\nDisplay the 95% and 99% confidence level on the chart in order to visualize the uncertainty\r\n5\r\nThe left chart is sorting alphabetically while the right chart is sorting descendingly based on the proportion of “Strongly Agree” response. This can easily cause confusion without carefully inspecting the 2 Y-axis\r\nUse the same sort order for both charts\r\n\r\nAesthetic\r\n\r\n1\r\nThere are no coordination between the colors in the bar chart, giving the data visualization a messy look\r\nUse one shade of color to represent the positive or negative sentiment and use gradient colors to show the different strengths of each sentiment\r\n2\r\nTypo in the word “vaccine”\r\nUse the correct word\r\n3\r\nCountry names should be capitalized and should not contain special characters\r\nProperly display the country names\r\nProposed Design\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the survey contains multiple questions, an Overview section on top of the data visualization can provide some quick insights about the result of the survey.\r\nThe responses for the survey are following a Likert scale, hence using a divergent stacked bar chart is suitable as it allows easy comparison of response proportion across rows. To take it a step further, with the NeutraL response not being very useful in showing the general sentiment regarding the survey question, the Neutral bar will be split in half and each half will be placed on the outside to allow the stronger sentiments to be in the middle. This makes it easier to compare the strong sentiments between countries. Whether to show the Neutral bar in the chart should also be toggle-able by the user.\r\nThe dot chart on the right side will be used to visualize the proportion of a response to a survey question. The filter on top will allow the read to switch between different responses, including combined response such as “Strongly Agree & Agree”. Additionally, the chart will also display the 95% and 99% confidence interval to visualize the uncertainties for each country and the user be able to toggle the confidence intervals on and off.\r\nSome readers may prefer to combine similar responses with each other to convert the data into only three levels of sentiments. However, being able to see the proportion of the responses in details can be beneficial in some use cases e.g. comparing the responses between two countries with similar overall positive sentiments. As such, the data visualization should allow users to toggle the Granularity of the chart in order to choose between a simplified view or a detailed view.\r\nSome additional filters such as Age and Gender will be placed on the side the data visualization to allow users to filter out the respondents to a specific demographic.\r\nHow-to Guide\r\nData Cleaning\r\nThe dataset consists of 30 CSV files, one for each country. However, only 15 countries have the response for the questions that we want to visualize. For convenience, the dataset was combined and extracted using Jupyter Notebook with the following Python code:\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport glob\r\nimport os\r\n\r\npath = r'<Path to folder containing csv files>' # use your path\r\nall_files = glob.glob(os.path.join(path, \"*.csv\"))\r\n\r\ndf = pd.concat((pd.read_csv(f).assign(\r\n        filename = os.path.basename(f)) for f in all_files), ignore_index=True)\r\ncolumns = ['filename', 'age', 'gender', 'weight', 'employment_status', 'household_size',\r\n          'household_children', 'endtime', 'state', 'vac_1', 'vac2_1','vac2_2',\r\n          'vac2_3', 'vac2_6', 'vac_3']\r\n\r\ndf[df['vac_1'].notnull()][columns].to_csv('preped_data.csv')\r\nThe final data file can be Download Here\r\nOpen Tableau and connect to the data file from the previous section.\r\nRight-click on the Filename column and select Split\r\nHide the Filename column and rename the new Filename - Split 1 column to Country\r\nRight-click on the Country column and select Alias then set the country names to the proper format with capitalization.\r\nRename the following columns to their respective question:\r\nvac_1 - I am worried about getting COVID19\r\nvac2_1 - I am worried about potential side effects of a COVID19 vaccine\r\nvac2_2 - I believe government health authorities in my country will provide me with an effective COVID19 vaccine\r\nvac2_3 - If a Covid-19 vaccine becomes available to me a year from now, I definitely intend to get it\r\nvac2_6 - If a Covid-19 vaccine were made available to me this week, I would definitely get it\r\nvac_3 - If I do not get a COVID19 vaccine when it is available, I will regret it\r\n\r\nSelect all the question columns in step 5 and Pivot them\r\nRename the pivoted columns to Question and Answer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDivergent Stacked Bar\r\nGo to Sheet1 and rename the sheet to Likert.\r\nCreate the following Parameters:\r\nGranularity:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNeutral

But before that, let’s setup the shared Filters for all the charts.\r\nCreate a new worksheet named Question.\r\nAdd Question attribute into the Filters card.\r\nSet the title shading to grey and edit the title as follow:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOpen the Likert sheet\r\nGroup the ages into groups by right-click on the Age measure and select Create > Group.\r\nAdd Question, Age Group, Employment Status, Gender, Household Size into the Filters card. The Answer pill should already be in the Filters.\r\nFor the Question pill in Filters, right-click and select Apply to Worksheets > Selected Worksheets with the following selection:\r\nLikert\r\nConfidence Interval\r\nTooltip\r\nQuestion\r\n\r\nFor all other pills in Filters, select Apply to Worksheets > All Using this Data Source.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate a new dashboard and name it COVID-19 Vaccine Sentiments.\r\nSet the size to automatic or custom size. For myself, I set the custom size to 1700 x 1200.\r\nAdd a title for the dashboard on top.\r\nAdd the sheets Likert, Confidence Interval, Overview and Question to the dashboard in this layout:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMove all the filters and parameters to the right side of the dashboard, except for the Response Selector and the Show parameters, which should be placed at the top of the Confidence Interval chart.\r\nSet Gender to display as radio buttons.\r\nSet Question, Response Selector, Show, Sort By, Granularity, Neutral Response to display as dropdown lists.\r\nFinal Dashboard\r\nLink to Tableau Public\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn alternative view of the final dashboard, with the parameters set to display the responses in more details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInsights\r\nThe first insight can be observed from the overview section:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJapan is the most worrisome country when it comes to COVID-19, which aligns with how East Asian countries are generally more wary of the virus. Denmark, which has one of the most comprehensive social welfare and healthcare system in the world has the most trust in their government to provide them with an effective vaccine. United Kingdom people are both the most receptive and the most eager to getting a COVID-19 vaccine.\r\nGlobally, people of age 60 and above are more willingly to get a COVID-19 vaccine within the next week. This is most likely because this age group has much higher risk when contracted with the virus compared to younger people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrance is the country that is least agreeable when it comes to getting COVID-19 vaccine next week. However, they are much more likely to get the vaccine a year from now. This seems to indicate their skepticism against the current versions of vaccine and they are willing to wait to get a maybe better or safer version.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The text is also not clear if it’s referring to the median age of the labour force or the median age of the population\r\nThe median lines should be removed. Some simple annotation would suffice to state the median age in 2009 and 2019\r\n3\r\nTitle does not represent the message the data visualization tries to convey\r\nRewrite the title to better describe the data visualization\r\n4\r\nThe line graph does not have a Y-axis\r\nAdd a Y-axis and clearly label the ticks with percentage\r\n\r\nAesthetic\r\n\r\n1\r\nThe background color being grey serves no purpose and makes the 2 colors in the visualization less contrasting. These choice of colors would also be indistinguishable if the report is not color printed\r\nUse a white background with a colored border around the visualization if needed\r\n2\r\nTable headers are used as the x-axis of the table which makes the line graph on top looks out of place\r\nUse a separate chart instead\r\n3\r\n“70&Over” is too long for the table cell, making it look crammed\r\n“70+” would be more space efficient while still able to convey the meaning\r\nProposed Design\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow-to Guide\r\nButterfly Chart\r\nCopy the data into a new Excel worksheet as the original file has a lot of formatting.\r\nOpen Tableau and connect to the data in the new Excel worksheet.\r\nHold Ctrl and click on the columns 2009 and 2019.\r\nRight-click on one of the selected columns and select Pivot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRename the pivoted columns to Year and Labour Force and change the data type of column Year column to Date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGo to Sheet1 and rename the sheet to 2009.\r\nDrag-and-drop Year and Labour Force to the Columns card and Age to the Rows card.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRight-click on the Year pill to select Filter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUn-check 2019 from the list and select OK.\r\nRight-click on the Labour Force pill and select Quick Table Calculation > Percentage of Total.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHold Ctrl, drag-and-drop the Labour Force pill from the Columns card to Color in the Marks card.\r\nIn the Marks card, click on Label and select Show marks labels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRight-click on the X-axis and select Edit Axis:\r\nIn the Range section, select Fixed and set the start and end values to 0 and 0.175, respectively.\r\nIn the Scale section, select Reversed.\r\nSet the title of the axis to 2009.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRight-click on the Age (Years) pill and un-check Show Header.\r\nRight-click on the Year pill and un-check Show Header.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Toolbar, select Format > Lines:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Columns tab, set Grid Lines to None.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSwitch to the Format Borders tool, under the Sheet tab.\r\nSet Row Divider Pane to None and Column Divider Pane to None.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bar chart should looks as below\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuplicate the 2009 sheet and rename it 2019.\r\nRight-click on the Year pill and select Edit Filter then un-check 2009 and check 2019.\r\nRight-click on the X-axis and select Edit Axis:\r\nUn-check Reversed.\r\nRename the axis’ title to 2019.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate a new sheet and name it Year.\r\nFrom the Toolbar, select Analysis > Create Calculated Field:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nName the calculated field Placeholder for Age.\r\nEnter 0 as the formula.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDrag-and-drop the Placeholder for Age field to the Columns card.\r\nDrag-and-drop the Age (Years) field to the Rows card.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChange the Marks type to Text.\r\nDrag-and-drop the Age (Years) field to Text in the Marks card.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRight-click on both the X-axis and Y-axis and un-check Show Header to hide the axis.\r\nRemove the sheet title.\r\nFrom the Toolbar, select Format > Lines:\r\nOn the Sheet tab, set Axis Rulers to None.\r\nOn the Sheet tab, set Zero Lines to None.\r\nOn the Columns tab, set Grid Lines to None.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReduce the width of the “chart” as much as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate a new Dashboard.\r\nArrange the 3 previous created sheets in the Dashboard to achieve the Butterfly Chart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStacked Bar Chart\r\nCreate a new Sheet called Comparison.\r\nIn the Data pane, right-click on Age (Years) and select Create > Group:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSet the Field Name to Age Group.\r\nUse Shift to select and group all the age groups from 15 to 24 into a group named 15 - 24.\r\nGroup all the age groups from 25 to 54 into a group named 25 - 54.\r\nGroup all rest of the age groups into a group named 55 and over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDrag-and-drop Year into the Rows card and Labour Force into the Columns card.\r\nRight-click on the Labour Force pill and select Quick Table Calculation > Percentage of Total.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRight-click on the Labour Force pill and select Compute Using > Table (across).\r\nChange the Marks type to Bar.\r\nDrag-and-drop the Age Group group into Color in the Marks card.\r\nDrag-and-drop the Age Group group into Detail in the Marks card.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRight-click on the Age Group pill in the Marks card and select Sort. Choose Descending.\r\nSet the desired colors for the Age Group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRemove the title and field labels of Year.\r\nArrange the new bar chart into the final dashboard.\r\nFinally, add observations and annotation. Voila!\r\nFinal Dashboard\r\nLink to Tableau Public\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInsights\r\nSingapore seems to have an aging workforce as the distribution of the labour force is leaning more towards the older age group in 2019 compare to 2009.\r\nThe distribution of all the age groups from 60 and above has the largest increase in 2019 relative to 2009, indicating that elder people may still have to work instead of retiring.\r\nThe age group which held the largest share in 2009 is 35-39, however, by 2019, the age group with the biggest share has shifted to age group 45-49.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

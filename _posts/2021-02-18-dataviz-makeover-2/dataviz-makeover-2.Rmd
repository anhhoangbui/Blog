|#| <font size="4">Critique                        | <font size="4">Suggestion             |
|-|---------------------------------|------------------------|
||_**Clarity**_|
|1|The leading texts in the data visualization do not provide any adequate context for the reader to understand what the data visualization is about and the insights it is trying to convey|Clearly state the purpose of the data visualization with some short description|
|2|The legend is unclear in that the values "2", "3" and "4" by itself does not provide any explanation as to which color in the chart represent which answer. Not only that, "Vac_1" is also meaningless to users since it is only a code to refer to the actual question|The survey question should be clearly displayed in the data visualization, not necessarily above the legend|
|3|A 100% stacked bar chart is not a suitable visualization for this data since it can be difficult to compare the bars between countries|Use a divergent stacked bar chart|
|4|The bar chart on the right is trying to show the percentage of the "Strongly Agree" response to the survey question, which contains uncertainties since a survey does not represent the whole population, hence the chart needs to also visualize the uncertainty |Display the 95% and 99% confidence level on the chart in order to visualize the uncertainty|
|5|The left chart is sorting alphabetically while the right chart is sorting descendingly based on the proportion of "Strongly Agree" response. This can easily cause confusion without carefully inspecting the 2 Y-axis|Use the same sort order for both charts|
||_**Aesthetic**_|
|1|There are no coordination between the colors in the bar chart, giving the data visualization a messy look|Use one shade of color to represent the positive or negative sentiment and use gradient colors to show the different strengths of each sentiment|
|2|Typo in the word "vaccine"|Use the correct word|
|3|Country names should be capitalized and should not contain special characters|Properly display the country names|

## Proposed Design

```{r layout="1-body"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sketch.png")
```

+ Since the survey contains multiple questions, an **Overview** section on top of the data visualization can provide some quick insights about the result of the survey. 
+ The responses for the survey are following a Likert scale, hence using a **divergent stacked bar** chart is suitable as it allows easy comparison of response proportion across rows. To take it a step further, with the **NeutraL** response not being very useful in showing the general sentiment regarding the survey question, the **Neutral** bar will be split in half and each half will be placed on the outside to allow the stronger sentiments to be in the middle. This makes it easier to compare the strong sentiments between countries. Whether to show the **Neutral** bar in the chart should also be toggle-able by the user.
+ The dot chart on the right side will be used to visualize the proportion of a response to a survey question. The filter on top will allow the read to switch between different responses, including combined response such as "Strongly Agree & Agree". Additionally, the chart will also display the **95% and 99% confidence interval** to visualize the uncertainties for each country and the user be able to toggle the confidence intervals on and off.
+ Some readers may prefer to combine similar responses with each other to convert the data into only three levels of sentiments. However, being able to see the proportion of the responses in details can be beneficial in some use cases e.g. comparing the responses between two countries with similar overall positive sentiments. As such, the data visualization should allow users to toggle the **Granularity** of the chart in order to choose between a simplified view or a detailed view.
+ Some additional filters such as **Age** and **Gender** will be placed on the side the data visualization to allow users to filter out the respondents to a specific demographic.

## How-to Guide
### Data Cleaning

The dataset consists of 30 CSV files, one for each country. However, only 15 countries have the response for the questions that we want to visualize. For convenience, the dataset was combined and extracted using Jupyter Notebook with the following Python code:
```
import pandas as pd
import glob
import os

path = r'<Path to folder containing csv files>' # use your path
all_files = glob.glob(os.path.join(path, "*.csv"))

df = pd.concat((pd.read_csv(f).assign(
        filename = os.path.basename(f)) for f in all_files), ignore_index=True)
columns = ['filename', 'age', 'gender', 'weight', 'employment_status', 'household_size',
          'household_children', 'endtime', 'state', 'vac_1', 'vac2_1','vac2_2',
          'vac2_3', 'vac2_6', 'vac_3']

df[df['vac_1'].notnull()][columns].to_csv('preped_data.csv')
```

The final data file can be [Download Here](https://smu-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/ahbui_2019_mitb_smu_edu_sg/ER_fKuT_8lhDlgtD0OxV14gBd2aA58PrjiZxXMr_Eg0Sog?e=Wexnds)

1. *Open* **Tableau** and connect to the data file from the previous section.
2. *Right-click* on the **Filename** column and select **Split**
3. Hide the **Filename** column and rename the new **Filename - Split 1** column to **Country**
4. *Right-click* on the Country column and select Alias then set the country names to the proper format with capitalization.
5. Rename the following columns to their respective question:
    + *vac_1* - I am worried about getting COVID19
    + *vac2_1* - I am worried about potential side effects of a COVID19 vaccine
    + *vac2_2* - I believe government health authorities in my country will provide me with an effective COVID19 vaccine
    + *vac2_3* - If a Covid-19 vaccine becomes available to me a year from now, I definitely intend to get it
    + *vac2_6* - If a Covid-19 vaccine were made available to me this week, I would definitely get it
    + *vac_3* - If I do not get a COVID19 vaccine when it is available, I will regret it
6. Select all the question columns in step 5 and **Pivot** them
7. Rename the pivoted columns to **Question** and **Answer**

```{r layout="1-body"}

END
```
    + Count Positive:
```
IF [Response] = "Agree" OR [Response] = "Strongly Agree" OR [Response] = "Agree "
THEN 1
ELSEIF [Response] = "Neutral" AND [Neutral Response] = TRUE

END
```
    + Label Negative:
```
IF  AVG([Neutral Check])*[Percentage Negative] = 0 THEN NULL

```
SUM([Count Positive])/SUM({Exclude [Response]:SUM([Number of Records])})
```
    + Sort By Field:
```
CASE [Sort By]
    WHEN 'Agree' THEN SUM([Count Agree])/SUM({Exclude [Response]:SUM([Number of Records])})
    WHEN 'Disagree' THEN SUM([Count Disagree])/SUM({Exclude [Response]:SUM([Number of Records])})
    WHEN 'Agree (Including Neutral)' THEN SUM([Count Positive])/SUM({Exclude [Response]:SUM([Number of Records])})

    IF [Answer] = "1 - Strongly agree" OR [Answer] = "2"
    THEN 1
    ELSE 0
    END
ELSEIF  [Response Selector] = "7" THEN
    IF [Answer] != "1 - Strongly agree" AND [Answer] != "2" AND [Answer] != "3"
    THEN 1
    ELSE 0
    END
ELSEIF [Answer] = [Response Selector] Then 1

### Dashboard
At this point we should have all the main components we need to arrange the dashboard. But before that, let's setup the shared Filters for all the charts.

1. Create a new worksheet named **Question**.
2. Add **Question** attribute into the **Filters** card.
3. Set the title shading to grey and edit the title as follow:

```{r,  out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/35question.png")
```

4. Open the **Likert** sheet
5. Group the ages into groups by *right-click* on the **Age** measure and select **Create > Group**.
6. Add **Question**, **Age Group**, **Employment Status**, **Gender**, **Household Size** into the **Filters** card. The **Answer** pill should already be in the Filters.
7. For the **Question** pill in **Filters**, *right-click* and select **Apply to Worksheets > Selected Worksheets** with the following selection:
    + Likert
    + Confidence Interval
    + Tooltip
    + Question
8. For all other pills in **Filters**, select **Apply to Worksheets > All Using this Data Source**.

```{r,  out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/36filters.png")
```

9. Create a new dashboard and name it **COVID-19 Vaccine Sentiments**.
10. Set the size to automatic or custom size. For myself, I set the custom size to 1700 x 1200.
11. Add a title for the dashboard on top.
12. Add the sheets **Likert**, **Confidence Interval**, **Overview** and **Question** to the dashboard in this layout:

```{r layout="l-body-outset"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/37layout.png")
```

13. Move all the filters and parameters to the right side of the dashboard, except for the **Response Selector** and the **Show** parameters, which should be placed at the top of the **Confidence Interval** chart.
14. Set **Gender** to display as radio buttons.
15. Set **Question**, **Response Selector**, **Show**, **Sort By**, **Granularity**, **Neutral Response** to display as dropdown lists.

## Final Dashboard

### Insights
+ The first insight can be observed from the overview section:

```{r,  out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/38insight1.png")
```

**Japan** is the most worrisome country when it comes to COVID-19, which aligns with how East Asian countries are generally more wary of the virus. **Denmark**, which has one of the most comprehensive social welfare and healthcare system in the world has the most trust in their government to provide them with an effective vaccine. **United Kingdom** people are both the most receptive and the most eager to getting a COVID-19 vaccine.

+ Globally, people of age 60 and above are more willingly to get a COVID-19 vaccine within the next week. This is most likely because this age group has much higher risk when contracted with the virus compared to younger people.

```{r,  out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/39insight2.png")
```

+ France is the country that is least agreeable when it comes to getting COVID-19 vaccine next week. However, they are much more likely to get the vaccine a year from now. This seems to indicate their skepticism against the current versions of vaccine and they are willing to wait to get a maybe better or safer version.

```{r,  out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/40insight3.png")
```
